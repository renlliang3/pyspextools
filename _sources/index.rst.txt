Welcome to pyspextools documentation!
=====================================

Welcome to pyspex tools, the python helper module for the `SPEX spectral fitting package <http://www.sron.nl/spex>`_.
This module offers a growing number of utilities and scripts that can help with analysing X-ray spectra using
SPEX.

Currently, the toolbox provides the following tools:

- Transformation of OGIP files to SPEX format,
- Generation of 'fake' spectra and responses for simulations,
- Programming interfaces to manipulate SPEX and OGIP fits files,
- Programming interface for using the SPEX user model.

This page offers the following help and documentation:
